 ## Lava Wallet

 #### Deposit tokens in this smart contract in order to allow smart contracts (and other users) to directly spend them with offchain digital signatures (without on chain approve() calls)




TO VERIFY:
1. Had to flatten so libs were inside the one file  
2. Deploy using Remix, it actually deployed two contracts (ecrecovery and lavawallet)
3. Verified ecrecovery by itself
4. Used the new Beta validator with the FULL flat file, point at the ecrecovery lib by address as well
